# hnreduce
HNReduce is a browser extension to create better habits for Hacker News. Hacker News can be a source of novel and interesting information.

However, I sometimes go directly to comments to gauge people's reactions rather than engage with the information

To be less mimetic and more intentional, I made hnreduce.
